### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior web developer currently working on my portfolio of self-inspired projects. I'm interested in design patterns, like accessibility and responsiveness, but especially game design. I am working on a web clock right now but soon will be back on my third iteration of my free web game: Dash-Man Jump!

I am open to work. Find me on X, linkedin, and gamejolt under this name.

Thanks for stopping by!
